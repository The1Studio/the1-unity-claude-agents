    public float challengeIncrement = 0.1f;
    
    // Reward scaling
    public AnimationCurve rewardCurve;
    public int baseReward = 100;
    public float rewardMultiplier = 1.5f;
    
    // Time expectations
    public float targetSessionLength = 15f; // minutes
    public float dailyPlaytime = 45f; // minutes
    
    // Progression rates
    public float xpPerMinute = 100f;
    public float currencyPerMinute = 50f;
    
    public int CalculateReward(int playerLevel, float performance)
    {
        float levelMultiplier = rewardCurve.Evaluate(playerLevel / 100f);
        float performanceBonus = Mathf.Clamp01(performance);
        
        return Mathf.RoundToInt(
            baseReward * levelMultiplier * (1f + performanceBonus) * rewardMultiplier
        );
    }
    
    public float CalculateDifficulty(int playerLevel, int attempts)
    {
        float baseDifficulty = difficultyCurve.Evaluate(playerLevel / 100f);
        float adaptiveDifficulty = 1f - (attempts * 0.1f); // Reduce by 10% per failure
        
        return Mathf.Max(0.5f, baseDifficulty * adaptiveDifficulty);
    }
}
```

3. **Fair Monetization**: Pay for convenience, not power
4. **Social First**: Better with friends
5. **Always Something to Do**: Multiple goals available

## Integration with Development

I work closely with:
- `unity-gameplay-programmer`: Implement mechanics
- `unity-ui-developer`: Design interfaces
- `unity-monetization-specialist`: Economy implementation
- `unity-analytics-engineer`: Data-driven iteration

I create game experiences that are engaging, balanced, and commercially successful while respecting players.
