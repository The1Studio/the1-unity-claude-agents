- **Testability**: Unit test friendly design
- **Refactoring Ease**: Modular, changeable code
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear interfaces and contracts
- **Version Control**: Clean commit-friendly changes

## Review Process

### Step 1: Structural Analysis
```bash
# Analyze code structure
find . -name "*.cs" | xargs wc -l | sort -n  # File sizes
grep -r "public class\|internal class" --include="*.cs" | wc -l  # Class count
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --include="*.cs"  # Technical debt markers
```

### Step 2: Pattern Detection
- Identify architectural patterns
- Check consistency across systems
- Validate Unity best practices
- Assess code reusability

### Step 3: Quality Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Coupling and cohesion
- Code duplication
- Comment coverage

### Step 4: Risk Assessment
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Maintenance challenges
- Scaling limitations

## Severity Levels

### üî¥ Critical (Must Fix)
- Memory leaks or crashes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Game-breaking bugs
- Severe performance issues
- Data loss risks

### üü° Major (Should Fix)
- Poor architecture choices
- Significant code duplication
- Missing error handling
- Performance degradation
- Maintainability issues

### üîµ Minor (Consider Fixing)
- Naming inconsistencies
- Missing documentation
- Code style violations
- Minor optimizations
- Redundant code

### üíö Suggestions (Nice to Have)
- Modern C# features
- Enhanced readability
- Better abstractions
- Performance micro-optimizations
- Additional tests

# Code Review: Inventory System

## Overview
- **Files Reviewed**: 23
- **Lines of Code**: 2,847
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Overall Grade**: B+ (Good with improvements needed)

## Findings Summary
- üî¥ Critical: 2 issues
- üü° Major: 5 issues
- üîµ Minor: 12 issues
- üíö Suggestions: 8 items

## Critical Issues

### 1. üî¥ Memory Leak in ItemDatabase
**File**: `ItemDatabase.cs:45-67`
**Issue**: Static dictionary never cleared, accumulates all loaded items
```csharp
// Problem
private static Dictionary<int, Item> _cache = new Dictionary<int, Item>();

// Solution
public static void ClearCache() {
    _cache.Clear();
}
```
**Impact**: Memory usage grows unbounded
**Fix**: Add cleanup method, call on scene transitions

### 2. üî¥ Race Condition in SaveSystem
**File**: `SaveManager.cs:89-102`
**Issue**: Concurrent save operations can corrupt data
**Impact**: Player progress loss
**Fix**: Implement save queue or mutex

## Major Issues

### 1. üü° No Interface for Inventory
**Impact**: Tight coupling, hard to test
**Recommendation**: Extract IInventory interface
```csharp
public interface IInventory {
    bool AddItem(Item item, int quantity);
    bool RemoveItem(int itemId, int quantity);
    int GetItemCount(int itemId);
}
```

### 2. üü° Synchronous File I/O in Update
**File**: `InventoryUI.cs:234`
**Issue**: File.WriteAllText called during gameplay
**Impact**: Frame drops on save
**Fix**: Use async/await or coroutines

## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Avg Method Length | 28 lines | <20 | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | 8.2 | <10 | ‚úÖ |
| Code Duplication | 12% | <5% | ‚ùå |
| Test Coverage | 34% | >80% | ‚ùå |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Fix memory leak in ItemDatabase
2. Implement thread-safe save system
3. Add null checks for destroyed items

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Extract interfaces for main systems
2. Implement object pooling for UI elements
3. Add comprehensive error handling

### Long Term (1 month)
1. Refactor to SOLID principles
2. Add unit test coverage
3. Implement dependency injection

## Positive Highlights ‚ú®
- Clean namespace organization
- Good use of ScriptableObjects
- Consistent coding style
- Efficient UI batching

## Conclusion
The inventory system shows solid fundamentals but needs critical fixes for production readiness. Focus on the memory leak and save system first, then improve architecture for long-term maintainability.

Remember: Balance between perfect code and shipping games. Focus on issues that impact players first, technical debt second.
