# Unity Claude Agents - Unity Game Development AI Team üéÆ

**Supercharge Claude Code with a team of specialized Unity AI agents** that work together to build complete game features, optimize performance, and handle any Unity development challenge with expert-level knowledge.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This project is experimental and token-intensive.** Unity game development involves complex multi-system interactions. Multi-agent orchestration can consume 10-50k tokens per complex feature. Use with caution and monitor your usage.

## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated
- **Claude subscription** - required for intensive agent workflows
- **Unity 2022.3 LTS or later** (Unity 6000.1+ recommended)
- Active Unity project directory

### 1. Install the Agents
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The1Studio/the1-unity-claude-agents.git
```

#### Option A: Symlink (Recommended - auto-updates)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/the1-unity-claude-agents" ~/.claude/agents
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cmd /c mklink /D "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\agents" "$(Get-Location)\the1-unity-claude-agents"
```

#### Option B: Copy (Static - no auto-updates)
```bash
cp -r the1-unity-claude-agents ~/.claude/
```

### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
claude /agents
# Should show all 40+ Unity agents.
```

### 3. Initialize Your Unity Project
**Navigate** to your **Unity project directory** (where Assets/ folder is) and run:

```bash
claude "use @unity-team-configurator and optimize my Unity project to best use the available subagents."
```

### 4. Start Building
```bash
claude "use @unity-tech-lead-orchestrator and create a player movement system with jumping"
```

Your Unity AI team will automatically detect your Unity version, render pipeline, and use the right specialists!

## üéØ How Auto-Configuration Works

The @unity-team-configurator automatically sets up your perfect Unity development team. When invoked, it:

1. **Locates CLAUDE.md** - Finds existing project configuration in your Unity project root
2. **Detects Unity Stack** - Inspects Unity version, render pipeline (URP/HDRP/Built-in), platforms, and packages
3. **Discovers Available Agents** - Scans ~/.claude/agents/ for Unity specialists
4. **Selects Specialists** - Matches agents to your Unity setup (mobile, VR, multiplayer, etc.)
5. **Updates CLAUDE.md** - Creates a Unity-specific "AI Team Configuration" section
6. **Provides Usage Guidance** - Shows detected Unity setup and sample commands

## üìä Token Usage Guidelines

Unity development workflows can be token-intensive:
- **Simple features**: 5-10k tokens (player movement, UI screens)
- **Complex systems**: 20-40k tokens (multiplayer, save systems)
- **Full features**: 40-80k tokens (complete game mechanics with optimization)

Tips to manage usage:
1. Break large features into smaller tasks
2. Use specific agents directly for focused work
3. Let orchestrators handle only complex multi-system features

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Agent not found"
- Verify installation path: `ls ~/.claude/`
- Check agent names: `claude /agents | grep unity`
- Ensure proper symlink/copy

### "High token usage"
- Use specific agents instead of orchestrators for simple tasks
- Break complex features into smaller chunks
- Monitor usage with Claude's token counter
