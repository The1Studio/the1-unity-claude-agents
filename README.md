# Unity Game Dev Agents 🎮

**A specialized collection of Unity development AI agents for Claude Code**

> **⚡ Built for Claude Code**: These agents are optimized for Claude Code's agent orchestration system, providing expert Unity development assistance through specialized AI agents that work together as a cohesive team.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later (Unity 6000.1+ recommended)
- Basic familiarity with Unity development

### Installation

**Option 1: Direct Download (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download the team configuration to your Unity project root
curl -L -o CLAUDE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the1-unity-claude-agents/main/unity-game-dev-agents/CLAUDE.md
```

**Option 2: Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the1-unity-claude-agents/unity-game-dev-agents.git
cd unity-game-dev-agents
cp unity-game-dev-agents/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/unity/project/
```

**Option 3: Manual Setup**
1. Download [`CLAUDE.md`](./unity-game-dev-agents/CLAUDE.md)
2. Place it in your Unity project root directory (same level as Assets/)
3. Open Claude Code in your Unity project directory

### First Steps

1. **Initialize your AI team:**
   ```
   "Analyze my Unity project and configure the development team"
   ```

2. **Start building:**
   ```
   "Create a player controller with smooth movement and jumping"
   ```

The `unity-tech-lead-orchestrator` will automatically:
- ✅ Detect your Unity version and render pipeline
- ✅ Analyze your project structure
- ✅ Route tasks to appropriate specialists
- ✅ Coordinate implementation across agents

## ✨ How It Works

### Intelligent Orchestration
Unlike single AI assistants, this system uses **intelligent task routing**:

1. **unity-tech-lead-orchestrator** receives your request
2. Analyzes the task complexity and requirements
3. Routes work to appropriate Unity specialists
4. Coordinates implementation across multiple agents
5. Ensures Unity best practices and performance optimization

### Example Workflow
```
You: "Create a multiplayer racing game for mobile"

unity-tech-lead-orchestrator coordinates:
├── unity-mobile-developer: Platform optimization
├── unity-multiplayer-engineer: Netcode implementation  
├── unity-physics-programmer: Vehicle physics
├── unity-performance-optimizer: Mobile performance
└── unity-monetization-specialist: IAP integration
```
